  Concept & Ideation
    </h2>
    <p>

  The story focuses on how it feels to experience mood swings. The main ideas behind this
  animation short film is focused on a person who is struggling with extreme Mood swings
  without getting any rest. His mind keeps switching between high and low mental states,
  good and bad moods, and his goal is to try to balance his mind in order to live normally.

  Story

  </h2>

<p>
  The story line will start with the main character dreaming of a memory of him being
  born. His brain organâ€™s shape will be different than normal looking brains. After he
  wakes up the story starts with a normal day where he taking a walk with a scene
  that fast forwards through his days. At first he has a very regular/boring life until one
  day he stumbles on his already troubled mind/head. He hits his head so hard, his
  brain is already split into two parts, but now it is even worse, each part of his brain
  is now rotated; this scene is a conceptual trigger of the start of his Mood Swings. He
  somehow survives the incident, and now he has to live with his new condition.
  When he returns home after he attempts sleep he finds himself ripped apart
  between two types of hallucinations, which is positive and negative throughout the
  rest of the film. These positive and negative hallucinations will have the main
  character experiencing high and low moods, in which he will sometimes be
  extremely depressed and experience scary or horrifying situations, meanwhile he
  will also in some instances experience Euphoria, high mood, and even mania.
  Throughout a large part of the film he will keep experiencing excessive switching
  between these hallucinating moods. In the conclusion of the story he will realize that
  all these mood shifting is in his head and finds a way to balance his moods.
